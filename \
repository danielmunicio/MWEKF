Pipeline 131 documentation
==========================
Welcome to the Formula Electric at Berkeley Pipeline 131 Mk.S documentation! 
This site is meant to document our codebase that works on the `Endinburgh University Simulator <https://gitlab.com/eufs/eufs_sim>`_

Since we don't run perception, our pipeline on the simulator is more condensed, and consists of path-planning, localization, and control algorithms, depicted below:
